# imgproc

This project was made to demonstrate the use of OpenCV in facial emotion detection. 
The aim of the project was to create a custom dataset, detect a user's emotion, play a relavant song and apply an emoji (png) on the user's face.
More the number of user's images, better the emotion detection.
